title: "Tools which i self-host on my server"
summary: "I admire the process of self-hosting open source tools on my own server and being in total control of my own data. This also becomes a learning process as i have to maintain various different types of code-base on my server"

As it might be experience of everybody of us, human exisence feels quite limited without our tools. Humans are called intelligent beings because we invent tools and tools in-turn build us further. It's a cyclic thing. In this modern world, we are almost bound to experience parts of our lives by using various tools. We use tools to cook, tools to organise our life, tools to earn a living by working. Tools are everywhere around us. Moving further into this evolutionary cycles, the future A.I tools shall probably build more tools for themselves automatically and finally this need of humans inventing new tools and managing them can be left out of the equation. However, i admire such future is much far away from now.

Anyhow, i quickly noticied that all the tools provide us with conveince and Conveince is almost like an addiction to most of us now, our reliance to our tools is too extreme that we have forgotten how life would feel without our tools.

This reliance on our tools, motivates the engineer mindset within me to look underneath into the tools, how they work and function, how these tools create meaningful functionalities by creating a eco-system of co-dependence amongst various smaller sub-sets of tools. It's fascinating to me.

Hence, i've started to self-host various open source technological tools used by us in our day-to-day life to better understand them, it further develops my ability as a system adminstrator on how to maintain such tools and explore various new technologies associated with these tools.

Below is a list of tools i self-host on my bare-metal linux server, both for conveince and my own knowledge expansion.

- Homarr as a dashboard
- lnav to view system log files
- m/monit for process monitoring
- glances for system resourse monitoring
- statping for frontend monitoring and alert
- munin for system graphs
- docker for hosting containers
- goaccess for website log analyzer
- owncloud as an docker replacement
- resilio sync as sync replacement
- dash as sserver resource monitrogin
- gotify for alerts
- thelounge and znc for IRC chats
- tracks for GTD setup
- paperless-ngx for scanned documents
- piped and libertube for youtube
- metabase for business analytics
- standard notes for note taking
- wikijs for hosting my digital garden of knowledge
- pihole for dns filtering

Done!
