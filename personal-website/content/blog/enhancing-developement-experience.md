I enhanced my developer experience (DX) for web development by using following toolkits, frameworks, workflows and more.

- Pre commit hooks
- CI (share some github actions)
- git flow
- sphinx documentation
- virtual enviroments
- debug consoles
- development servers (debut toolbars)
- code quality tools (editoconfig, black, isort, flake8)
- reorder_python_imports, Mypy, Shellcheck
- seeding your developement databases
- django-version-checks, run tests
- 12factors
- using cookiecutters
- Using docstrings
- Debugging workflows for C.I Locally

I will be describing each of them in detail during my next update. Stay tuned.
